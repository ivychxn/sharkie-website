        i have a pink fujifilm mini 11 so any amount of film refills would be nice.
        i feel like that's easy to put on here bc i don't think i can really ever have /too/ much.
        i might just buy them myself if i'm running out tho

        i like rainbow sandals and i don't really have slides like these so now it's on here. i think
        it would be good for like casual lil outtings and stuff with like, moderate to no walking bc
        this one is single layer but also yolo whatever if i gotta walk then i gotta walk. i still have my reg
        rainbow flip flops that i bought a few years ago and they're still comfy. i wear medium size for those
        so i think medium here should be fine too? pictured is <b>sierra brown color</b> and that's the only one i want.

        i want a smol lil camera to play around with. not really a priority or anything i just think it would be fun.
        i don't want any fancy features - just the ability to take photos and videos and then some easy way to get it
        onto my laptop. i dont want any wifi backup or whatever weird features bc i alr have my phone for all that
      </p>
      <p>
        no color preference no brand preference not very picky at all. some of these cameras can be hella expensive like
        hundreds or thousands(?) but idk i'm not a real photographer or anything so a super cheap one works

        what can i say? marketing works on me bc i want one of these too. if this goes on sale i'd totally
        consider just getting it too bc cooling her down in the summer sounds nice.
        her body is like 24in ribcage, neck is about 14in so i think that's S size?

        so i think it would b nice to have more joycons for my switch but here's my issue:
        they come in pink / yellow, pink / pink, or purple / green.
        i wish they had pink / lavender.
        the yellow is eh to me and the green is nice ig but i alr have
        a light green from my animal crossing edition switch anyways

      <p>
        basically this is almost the same as my current rainbow sandals bc they're all just flip flops
        but this one is sliiightly different!! it has a different strap and a different brown and more
        importantly it's double layer arch support. mine rn is single layer and it would be nice to have
        a double layer one too bc i would imagine it's comfier. i wear size medium and i only want the <b>nogales wood</b> color</p>
      <p>
        tbh i would have gotten double layer from the start but i didn't wanna bc it wasn't on sale when i bought it in 2018(?) or whatever year it was in college

        such a feel good item bc it smells so nice. i love this brand 
        and i saw it at costco originally but it's no longer at costco. 
        i saw this brand is also at ulta but not all the items are there
